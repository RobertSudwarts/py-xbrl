## I Have a Question

> If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have read the available [Documentation](https://py-xbrl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](https://github.com/manusimidt/py-xbrl/issues) that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following:

- If you have a generic question or suggestion please open  the [Discussion Forum](https://github.com/manusimidt/py-xbrl/discussions).
- If you have a problem with the libary or something is not working please open a new [Issue](https://github.com/manusimidt/py-xbrl/issues/new)

### Reporting Bugs

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. Additionally, if possible, please **append the link to the XBRL document** you encountered the bug with or share it otherwise. It greatly helps us to replicate and solve the bug!

#### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?

We use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/manusimidt/py-xbrl/issues/new).
- Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior.
- Please provide as much context as possible and describe the *reproduction steps* that someone else can follow to recreate the issue on their own. This usually includes your code. For good bug reports you should isolate the problem and create a reduced test case.
- Please link or append the XBRL document with which you entcountered the issue

### Improving The Documentation
The documentation of `py-xbrl` is build with [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/). It utilizes both `.rst` files and also in-code documentation in order to build the docs. You can find the `.rst` files in the [docs Folder](https://github.com/manusimidt/py-xbrl/tree/main/docs). Feel free to create an Issue or open a Pull request if you want to improve some part of the documentation.
